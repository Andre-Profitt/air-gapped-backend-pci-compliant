# Security Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive security information for the air-gapped PCI compliant backend system.

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors (Mitigated)

1. **Network Attacks**: Completely eliminated through air-gap
2. **Physical Access**: Multi-layer physical security
3. **Insider Threats**: Dual-person integrity, audit trails
4. **Supply Chain**: Verified media, cryptographic signatures
5. **Side Channel**: HSM protection, Faraday cage

### Security Controls

#### Preventive Controls
- Physical isolation (air-gap)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control (RBAC + MFA)
- Input validation
- Secure coding practices

#### Detective Controls
- Blockchain audit trail
- Integrity monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Security event logging

#### Corrective Controls
- Incident response procedures
- Backup and recovery
- Key rotation
- Patch management

## Cryptographic Standards

### Algorithms
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256-GCM
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA-4096-OAEP
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA256 (100,000 iterations)
- **Hashing**: SHA3-512
- **Message Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256

### Key Management
- Keys generated in HSM
- No keys leave HSM in plaintext
- Automatic key rotation (90 days)
- Split knowledge for master keys
- Secure key destruction

## Access Control

### Authentication Factors
1. **Knowledge**: Complex passphrase (15+ chars)
2. **Possession**: Hardware token (FIDO2)
3. **Inherence**: Biometric (fingerprint + facial)

### Authorization Model
```yaml
roles:
  security_officer:
    - manage_keys
    - configure_security
    - view_all_logs
    
  operator:
    - process_transactions
    - tokenize_data
    - view_transaction_logs
    
  auditor:
    - view_audit_logs
    - generate_reports
    - verify_compliance
```

## Secure Operations

### Daily Security Tasks
1. Review audit logs
2. Check system integrity
3. Verify HSM status
4. Monitor physical security
5. Validate backups

### Incident Response

#### Detection
- Automated alerts
- Log analysis
- Integrity checks
- Physical monitoring

#### Response Procedures
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Notify security team
4. Execute response plan
5. Document actions

#### Recovery
1. Verify system integrity
2. Restore from secure backup
3. Re-validate security
4. Resume operations
5. Post-incident analysis

## Security Hardening

### Operating System
```bash
# Kernel parameters
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
kernel.kptr_restrict = 2
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 3

# Network disabled
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
```

### Application
- No dynamic code execution
- Minimal attack surface
- Process isolation
- Resource limits
- Security monitoring

## Compliance Validation

### Security Testing
- Static code analysis (daily)
- Vulnerability scanning (weekly)
- Penetration testing (quarterly)
- Security audit (annual)

### Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- System integrity violations
- Encryption failures
- Audit trail gaps
