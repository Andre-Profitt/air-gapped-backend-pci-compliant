# PCI DSS Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates how the air-gapped PCI compliant backend meets all PCI DSS v3.2.1 requirements.

## Compliance Matrix

### Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration

**Implementation:**
- Physical air-gap eliminates network attack vectors
- Hardware-based access controls
- No network interfaces enabled

**Evidence:**
- Network interface configuration shows all disabled
- Physical security audit reports
- Access control logs

### Requirement 2: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults

**Implementation:**
- All default passwords changed during setup
- Hardened OS configuration
- Custom security parameters

**Evidence:**
- Configuration scripts in `/scripts/setup.sh`
- Security validation reports
- No default accounts enabled

### Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data

**Implementation:**
- PAN tokenization with secure tokens
- Encryption using AES-256-GCM
- HSM for key management
- No storage of sensitive authentication data

**Evidence:**
- Tokenization implementation in `TokenVault` class
- HSM configuration and key management procedures
- Data retention policies

### Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data

**Implementation:**
- All data transfers via encrypted media
- Cryptographic signatures on all packages
- No network transmission (air-gapped)

**Evidence:**
- `SecureFileTransfer` implementation
- Media handling procedures
- Encryption verification logs

### Requirement 5: Protect all systems against malware

**Implementation:**
- Read-only root filesystem
- Application whitelisting
- Isolated malware scanning station
- No external code execution

**Evidence:**
- System configuration files
- AIDE integrity reports
- Malware scan logs

### Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems

**Implementation:**
- Secure coding standards enforced
- Code review process
- Vulnerability management
- Change control procedures

**Evidence:**
- Static analysis reports (Bandit)
- Code review records
- Vulnerability scan results

### Requirement 7: Restrict access by business need-to-know

**Implementation:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Least privilege principle
- Access review procedures

**Evidence:**
- RBAC configuration in `AccessControl`
- User role assignments
- Access review reports

### Requirement 8: Identify and authenticate access

**Implementation:**
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Unique user IDs
- Strong password policy
- Account lockout mechanisms

**Evidence:**
- Authentication logs
- Password policy configuration
- MFA implementation details

### Requirement 9: Restrict physical access

**Implementation:**
- Secured facility with badge access
- Biometric controls
- Visitor procedures
- Media handling controls

**Evidence:**
- Physical security assessment
- Access logs and CCTV records
- Visitor logs

### Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access

**Implementation:**
- Blockchain-based audit trail
- Comprehensive logging
- Log integrity protection
- Daily log review

**Evidence:**
- Audit trail integrity verification
- Log review procedures
- Retention policies (7 years)

### Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems

**Implementation:**
- Automated security testing
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual security assessment
- Continuous monitoring

**Evidence:**
- Test results and reports
- Vulnerability scan outputs
- Penetration test findings

### Requirement 12: Maintain an information security policy

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive security policy
- Annual policy review
- Security awareness training
- Incident response procedures

**Evidence:**
- Policy documents
- Training records
- Incident response tests

## Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)

**Type:** SAQ-D for Service Providers

**Scope:**
- Payment processing application
- Secure storage systems
- Physical security controls
- Personnel with access

## Compensating Controls

### Network Security
**Standard Requirement:** Network firewall
**Compensating Control:** Physical air-gap
**Justification:** Eliminates all network-based attacks

### Anti-Virus
**Standard Requirement:** Anti-virus on all systems
**Compensating Control:** Read-only OS + application whitelisting
**Justification:** Prevents malware execution
