## Overview

This Incident Response Plan (IRP) defines procedures for responding to security incidents affecting the air-gapped PCI compliant backend system. All incidents must be handled according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.10.

### Objectives
- Minimize impact of security incidents
- Preserve forensic evidence
- Ensure proper notification
- Restore normal operations
- Prevent incident recurrence

## Response Procedures

### 1. Detection & Analysis

#### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency response script

# 1. Isolate affected systems
systemctl stop pci-backend
systemctl stop pci-transfer

# 2. Preserve volatile data
cp -rp /proc/[pid]/ /secure/forensics/
cp -rp /var/log/pci/* /secure/forensics/

# 3. Generate system snapshot
dd if=/dev/sda of=/secure/forensics/disk.img bs=4M

# 4. Secure physical access
echo "SECURITY ALERT: Lock down server room immediately"
```

#### Initial Assessment Checklist
- [ ] Identify affected systems
- [ ] Determine incident scope
- [ ] Classify severity level
- [ ] Activate response team
- [ ] Begin evidence collection
- [ ] Document all actions

### 2. Containment

#### Short-term Containment
1. **Disconnect affected systems** (maintain air-gap)
2. **Disable compromised accounts**
3. **Block affected tokens/keys**
4. **Increase monitoring**

#### Long-term Containment
1. **Apply security patches**
2. **Replace compromised keys**
3. **Rebuild affected systems**
4. **Implement additional controls**

### 3. Eradication

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Review audit logs
- Analyze system changes
- Interview involved personnel
- Examine physical security

#### Remediation Steps
1. Remove malicious code
2. Close vulnerabilities
3. Update security controls
4. Verify system integrity

### 4. Recovery

#### System Restoration Checklist
- [ ] Verify backup integrity
- [ ] Restore from clean backups
- [ ] Regenerate encryption keys
- [ ] Re-initialize HSM
- [ ] Validate all security controls
- [ ] Perform vulnerability scan
- [ ] Conduct penetration test

#### Monitoring Enhancement
```yaml
# Enhanced monitoring configuration
monitoring:
  audit_frequency: continuous
  log_retention: 90_days
  alerts:
    - failed_auth_threshold: 1
    - data_access_anomaly: enabled
    - hsm_operation_failure: immediate
    - audit_gap_detection: enabled
```
